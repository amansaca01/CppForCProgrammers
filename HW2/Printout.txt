So far, I've learnt how to manage classes. 
Through this process, I found some subjects that I’d like to higlight as I think they will be really usefull in the future.
First of all, the use of references in order to be memory efficient, this is closely related the relevance of const variables, 
which I also learned. Vector iterations were algo a main hit for me in this week,  now I can go through them in several ways. 
Finally, but not less, I am now aware about the importance of empty initializations and space allocation, I never thought it 
to be that relevant, I learnt very well that a vector that you thought to be empty (but it is not) can ruin your hole code.

I’d like to mention that I introduced a small modification of Djisktra algorithm in the class ShortestPath in order to
reduce computing time. It is based in the idea that we can keep using the same closed set as far as we keep the same origin. 
This being so, I created a vector of queues as an attribute of the class, and kept saving closest paths to each node 
we’ve found through iteration. Each set is saved in a different queue of the vector based on the origin.
